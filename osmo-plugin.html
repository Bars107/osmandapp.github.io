<li class="help">OSM Advanced Live Monitoring plugin provides variety of features. It could be compared with Google Latitude or with other live services. It helps to share your location with friends.</li>
<p class="img"><img class="help" src="images/osmo/osmo-plugin.png" /></p>

<li class="help"> In order to connect/disconnect, join a group or share your location with friends please tap on the widget.</li>
<p class="img"><img class="help" src="images/osmo/osmo-activity.png" /></p>
This screen provides various functions. Top check box indicates whether you connected to the service.<br>
'Send my locations' - shows whether you send your locations to server or not. If you don't send your locations, you are in a ghost mode, so no one could see your location, but you could see all available locations.<br>
Below groups of devices are displayed. "Connected devices" is a special group of devices, which you connected manually. To all other groups you need to join via "Connect to" dialog.
<br/>
Every row displays a device and displays direction, distance to it and location updated time. If you click on the row, you will see a context menu per device.

<li class="help"> If you want to make peer to peer connection, you just need to know your "Tracker Id". Click Settings on the OsMo screen and select "Tracker Id". Now you can share it with your friend. 
<p class="img"><img class="help" src="images/osmo/personal-tracker-id.png" /></p>
Please be attentive this is a permanent connection, so in order to reset it, you need to "Regenerate Tracker Id" in the settings and all your listeners will be removed.</li>
<li class="help"> If you want to share only 1 session peer to peer, just select "Share" -> "Share current session" on the OsMo screen.</li>
<p class="img"><img class="help" src="images/osmo/share-session.png" /></p>
<li class="help"> If you get a proper link to join a group or to a connect device, you just need to click on it and OsmAnd will take care about everything automatically. In any trouble you can still join group or connect a device manually: on the OsMo screen click "Connect To" and enter alphabetic code.</li>
<p class="img"><img class="help" src="images/osmo/link-with-device.png" /></p>
<li class="help"> To track user or device on the map, you can select it from the OsMo activity and click "Show on Map". You also can set a device "As a Moving Target" so you can continuously watch the distance to it or even see updated navigation instructions.</li>
